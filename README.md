This project involves an in-depth analysis of life expectancy data, sourced from a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who). The primary goal of this analysis is to explore and visualize the underlying patterns using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and visualization of the results.

## Project Overview

The project includes the following key steps:
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, scaling features, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing the dataset to understand its structure and main characteristics.
3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Applying PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining the most significant components.
4. **3D Visualization:** Creating an interactive 3D scatter plot to visualize the life expectancy data based on the top three principal components, with a distinction between developing and developed countries.

## Interactive 3D Visualization

An interactive 3D PCA projection is included in the notebook, which allows for a better understanding of the data distribution among countries categorized as developing or developed. 

**Note:** If you are viewing this on GitHub, please download the notebook and run it in a local environment or a compatible platform like [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com) or [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) to interact with the 3D plot.
